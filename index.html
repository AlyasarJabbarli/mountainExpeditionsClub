                        <p>On every expedition, the number of participants is kept to a level to enable the highest
                            quality to be maintained. We do not want to be that company where you become a number or
                            even a blur after the expedition has finished, so we have a strict cut off point to ensure
                            that our groups never become too big.
                        </p>
                        <p>We strongly believe that by doing this our Mountain Expeditions Leaders are able to provide a
                            more personalised service and we find that group dynamics work much better than when
                            travelling in high numbers. Therefore, your success rate and enjoyment increases
                            immeasurably.</p>
